# Write Tests

## Overview
Generate comprehensive tests for the selected code, following testing best practices.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the code** to understand its purpose and behavior
2. **Identify test cases**:
   - Happy path (normal operation)
   - Edge cases (boundary conditions)
   - Error cases (invalid inputs, failures)
   - Integration points (if applicable)

3. **Write tests** that are:
   - Descriptive (clear test names)
   - Independent (no test dependencies)
   - Repeatable (consistent results)
   - Fast (quick execution)

4. **Include**:
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Assertions with clear error messages
   - Setup and teardown if needed

## Output Format
Provide complete, runnable test code with imports and any necessary setup.
